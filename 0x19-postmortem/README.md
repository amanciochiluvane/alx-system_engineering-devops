Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident - A Tale of Authentication Misadventures

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 09:00 AM - June 11, 2023, 06:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service took an unexpected vacation, leaving users stranded at the login gate. Approximately 70% of users found themselves locked out, resulting in widespread panic and a surge in calls to our support team.

üå©Ô∏è Lightning Strikes! ‚ö°

Timeline:
- 09:00 AM: The ominous clouds gathered as users reported login failures like a torrential downpour.
- 09:10 AM: The support team, armed with umbrellas, braved the storm of customer complaints flooding their inboxes.
- 09:15 AM: Suddenly, the monitoring systems were struck by lightning and sent out distress signals in the form of error alerts.
- 09:30 AM: Our intrepid engineers donned their raincoats and embarked on an investigation, tracing the problem's muddy footprints through the authentication service and its accompanying infrastructure.
- 10:00 AM: Initial theories suggested the storm might have caused a network connectivity issue, but the network team confirmed it was just Mother Nature's regular business, leaving us off the hook.
- 11:00 AM: Armed with a metaphorical magnifying glass, our detectives shifted their focus to the authentication service codebase, searching for the elusive bug hiding in the mist.
- 02:00 PM: In a twist of events, they decided to backtrack their steps and follow the breadcrumbs of recent code changes, suspecting they might have triggered this tempestuous tempest. Alas, they were led astray!
- 03:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the development team, who brought in their umbrellas with extra-large canopies for a fresh perspective.
- 04:00 PM: After diving into the log data, they discovered a surge of database connection errors‚Äîlike a tidal wave engulfing the system‚Äîduring the stormy period.
- 05:00 PM: The culprit emerged from the depths: a recent code change had unwittingly opened the floodgates of database connections, exceeding their limit and drowning the authentication service.
- 06:00 PM: With a mighty thunderclap, the issue was finally quelled by adjusting the database connection pool configuration and restarting the authentication service, as if waving a magic wand to calm the storm.

Root Cause and Resolution:
As it turns out, the code change had triggered a tidal wave of database connections, flooding the system beyond its limits. The authentication service, ill-prepared for this deluge, succumbed to the pressure and left users stranded. To restore peace and tranquility, the database connection pool configuration was adjusted to accommodate higher concurrency. A swift restart of the authentication service washed away the remnants of the issue and brought back sunny skies to our user experience.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent future episodes of chaos, we have devised a plan:

1. Code Review: We shall diligently review code changes, ensuring they come armed with their umbrellas of performance and scalability. Let no uninvited bugs rain on our parade!

2. Load Testing: Regularly subject our system to simulated storms of user traffic to identify any weak spots or scalability bottlenecks. We shall prepare our infrastructure for the worst weather conditions!

3. Monitoring and Alerting: Enhance our monitoring systems to be the trusty meteorologists of our web stack, promptly warning us of any signs of impending storms, such as increased database connection errors. We shall never be caught off guard!

4. Automated Testing: Strengthen our automated

 testing suite to include weather-resistant integration tests for critical services like authentication. We shall ensure our system can withstand any climate!

‚òî Weatherproofing Measures ‚òÄÔ∏è

Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Conduct a thorough code review and optimize the authentication service to ensure it doesn't send an open invitation to database connection floods.
- Create automated load testing scenarios to simulate heavy storms of user activity and verify the resilience of our authentication service.
- Set up monitoring and alerting thresholds for database connection errors, ready to sound the alarm at the first drops of trouble.
- Organize training sessions to educate developers about scalability best practices and equip them with raincoats of knowledge.
- Implement a post-deployment checklist to verify the impact of code changes on critical services, preventing future downpours.

With these measures in place, we shall bask in the sunshine of a reliable and resilient web stack, shielding our users from the storms that lie beyond.
