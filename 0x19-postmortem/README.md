Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 09:00 AM - June 11, 2023, 06:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, rendering the login functionality unavailable for all users. Approximately 70% of the users were affected, leading to a significant disruption in accessing the platform.

Timeline:
- 09:00 AM: The issue was detected when users started reporting login failures.
- 09:10 AM: The support team noticed a sudden spike in customer complaints.
- 09:15 AM: Monitoring systems triggered alerts for increased error rates in the authentication service.
- 09:30 AM: Engineers initiated an investigation, focusing on the authentication service components and related infrastructure.
- 10:00 AM: Initial assumption was that the issue might be due to an infrastructure misconfiguration or network connectivity problem.
- 10:30 AM: Network team verified the infrastructure and found no issues.
- 11:00 AM: Debugging efforts were redirected towards the authentication service codebase.
- 02:00 PM: Several code changes were rolled back, assuming recent deployments caused the issue, but the problem persisted.
- 03:30 PM: Incident was escalated to the development team for further analysis and resolution.
- 04:00 PM: Detailed log analysis revealed a spike in database connection errors during the outage period.
- 05:00 PM: It was identified that the maximum allowed database connections were exceeded due to a recent code change.
- 06:00 PM: The issue was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool configuration and restarting the authentication service.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was an unexpected increase in database connections beyond the maximum allowed limit. This occurred due to a recent code change that did not account for the higher load on the authentication service. As a result, when the connection limit was reached, the service became unresponsive, preventing users from logging in.

To resolve the issue, the database connection pool configuration was adjusted to allow for a higher number of concurrent connections. Additionally, the authentication service was restarted to apply the configuration changes. These actions successfully restored the service and resolved the outage.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Code Review: Enhance the code review process to include thorough analysis of code changes for potential performance and scalability issues, particularly in critical services like authentication.

2. Load Testing: Introduce regular load testing scenarios to identify any scalability bottlenecks before deploying new code changes. This will help ensure the system can handle expected loads without exceeding resource limits.

3. Monitoring and Alerting: Strengthen the monitoring and alerting system to promptly notify the team of any abnormal behavior, such as increased database connection errors or high error rates. This will enable faster detection and response to critical issues.

4. Automated Testing: Expand the automated testing suite to include comprehensive integration tests for the authentication service. This will aid in uncovering potential issues related to database connections and other critical functionalities.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Review and optimize the authentication service code to reduce the number of database connections required during peak load.
- Implement automated load testing scenarios to simulate high user volumes and validate the behavior of the authentication service.
- Improve monitoring and alerting capabilities by setting up thresholds for database connection errors and other critical metrics.
- Conduct training sessions for developers to increase awareness of scalability concerns and best practices.
- Establish a post-deployment checklist to verify the impact of code changes on critical services, including authentication.

By implementing these measures, we aim to fortify the stability and reliability of our web stack, ensuring a seamless user experience even during periods of

 increased demand.
